## Overview

Understanding the behavior of data processing systems is hard. Questions like “Why does the system return certain results?” and “Why is the execution slow?” arise too often in data analytics. Answering such questions is still a cumbersome task that requires considerable amount of resources as well as manual work by experts.

The course focuses on algorithmic techniques and system design principles that help humans get meaningful insights into complex data processing pipelines. In the first two parts of the course, we will discuss methods for explaining outputs, including approaches from databases, recommendation engines, and interpretable machine learning.

In the third part, we will focus on techniques that help users understand execution performance. We will discuss traditional and causal profiling, end-to-end tracing, critical path analysis, and root-cause analysis.

At the end of the semester, successful students will have a solid understanding of:

- techniques that provide insights into the outputs and performance of data processing pipelines
- the challenges and trade-offs one needs to consider when designing systems with a focus on explainability and performance clarity

## Prerequisites
The course will be self-contained. Each one of the three parts will have an introductory lecture on the necessary concepts to understand the related research papers. Students must have strong programming skills (C/Python) and basic knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and computer systems (CS 112, CS 210 or equivalent experience).
