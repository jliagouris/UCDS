# Hands-on assignments

The hands-on assignments include programming exercises in [Ray](https://ray.io), a distributed data processing system.

### Software requirements
You can develop and execute Ray applications on Linux and macOS, while support for Windows is limited. 

To setup and run Ray, follow the instructions below:
- [Installing Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/installation.html)

Even though Ray is a distributed data processing system, you will typically develop and run initial tests on your local machine. This makes development easier and simplifies cluster deployment, as you can run the exact same code in a cluster environment without making any changes.

### Documentation is your friend
To get started with Ray, follow the steps in these quickstart tutorials:
- [Ray Tutorials and Examples](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/auto_examples/overview.html)

To successfully complete the assignments, always make sure to read the relevant documentation:
- [Ray documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/)
