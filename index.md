Welcome to **CS 591 L1: User-centric Data Systems**, Fall 2020

## Course Information

## Overview

Understanding the behavior of data systems is hard. Questions like “Why does the system return certain results?” and “Why is the execution slow?” arise too often in large-scale data analysis. Answering such questions is still a cumbersome task that requires considerable amount of resources as well as manual work by experts.

The course focuses on algorithmic techniques and design principles that help users get meaningful insights into the functionality of data processing systems. In the first part of the course, we will discuss methods for explaining system outputs, including approaches from databases, recommendation engines, and interpretable ML.

In the second part, we will focus on techniques that help users understand system performance. We will discuss traditional and causal profiling, end-to-end tracing, root-cause analysis, and invariant checking techniques.
