# Course Syllabus: CS 591 L1 "User-centric Systems for Data Science" (Fall 2020)

**Instructor Name**: John Liagouris  
**Office Location**: Hariri Institute for Computing, Room 163 <br />
**Course Time & Location**:	Tue/Thu 9:30-10:45, CAS B20  
**Office Hours**: TBD  

## Courseware
- We will use the [course website](https://jliagouris.github.io/UCDS20/) to maintain an up-to-date [class schedule](https://jliagouris.github.io/UCDS20/lectures.html).
- We will use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/bu/fall2020/cs591l1/home) for discussions on course topics, as well as questions and clarifications regarding the assignments. You may also post on Piazza if you have any question on course logistics.

## Course Description
CS 591 L1 will be taught in the style of a graduate course that requires reading research papers and independent exploration of the material.
The class will include lectures, readings, quizzes, programming assignments, a final (take-home) exam, and an optional final project.
During the semester, we will discuss the following topics:

- Data provenance
  - Lineage, Why, How and Where provenance
  - Why-not provenance
  - Database causality and responsibility
  - Backward tracing
- Model interpretability
  - Explaining classification results
  - Interpretting model predictions
- System performance analysis
  - Causal profiling
  - End-to-end tracing
  - Critical path analysis
  - Black-box performance analysis
  - Root-cause analysis

## Course Objectives
The course aims at training students in fundamental and emerging techniques that help humans understand complex data processing pipelines.
The course is divided in three parts. In Part I, we will discuss concepts of database provenance and causality that provide insights into query results. 
In Part II, we will discuss relevant AI techniques for explaining classifications and interpreting model predictions. 
In Part III, we will discuss state-of-the-art profiling, tracing, and performance analysis techniques for distributed systems.

At the end of the course, successful students will have a solid understanding of:
- techniques that provide insights into the outputs and performance of data processing pipelines
- the challenges and trade-offs one needs to consider when designing systems with a focus on explainability and performance clarity

## Course Materials
There is no required textbook for this class. After each lecture, slides will be published on the course website, 
in the "Slides" column of the [lecture schedule](https://jliagouris.github.io/UCDS20/lectures.html). 
Further publicly available resources are listed in the course website, under ["Readings"](https://jliagouris.github.io/UCDS20/readings.html). 
Parts of the resources listed there will be given as (non-graded) reading assignments during the course. 
You should be able to access all of these for free when connected to the campus network.

## Class Schedule
Please see the [schedule on the course website](https://jliagouris.github.io/UCDS20/lectures.html).

## Attendance
Students are expected to attend (even virtually) each lecture. 
For those who cannot attend, **all lectures will be prerecorded and the videos will be posted on Piazza**.
Ultimately, students are responsible for their own learning and, thus, for keeping up with the material.

## Grading Scheme
The course consists of lectures, exercises, and a final semester project. Your final grade will be determined as follows:
- **3 in-class quizzes (15%)**:
  - Each 15-min quiz contributes 5% to the final grade.
- **4 hands-on assignments (40%)**:
  - Assignment #1 contributes 10%.
  - Assignment #2 contributes 10%.
  - Assignment #3 contributes 10%.
  - Assignment #4 contributes 10%.
  - To be considered complete, code deliverables must be accompanied by sufficient documentation.
- **Final exam (45%)**:
  - Take-home exam over a 24-hour period with open-ended questions.
  
Students will have the option to do either the 4th assignment or a final project. You will have to propose your own idea for the final project and get the instructor's approval. **Project proposals must be submitted by October 16th**. In case you choose to do a final project, your grade will be determined as follows:
- **3 in-class quizzes (15%)**:
  - Each 15-min quiz contributes 5% to the final grade.
- **3 hands-on assignments (30%)**:
  - Assignment #1 contributes 10%.
  - Assignment #2 contributes 10%.
  - Assignment #3 contributes 10%.
  - To be considered complete, code deliverables must be accompanied by sufficient documentation.
- **Final exam (30%)**:
  - Take-home exam over a 24-hour period with open-ended questions.
- **Final project (25%)**:
  - To be considered complete, project deliverables must be accompanied by a report (max 10 pages).
  
## Late Submission
Assignments and final exam solutions will be submitted via Gradescope. 
Students who submit assignments late will only be eligible for up to **50% of the original score**. 

## Prerequisites
The course will be self-contained. Each one of the three parts will have an introductory lecture on the necessary concepts to understand the related research papers. Students must have strong programming skills (C/Python) and basic knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and computer systems (CS 112, CS 210 or equivalent experience).

## Academic Conduct
All assignments must be completed individually. 
Discussion with fellow students via Piazza or in-person are encouraged, but presenting the work of another person as your own is expressly forbidden. 
This includes "borrowing", "stealing", copying programs/solutions or parts of them from others. 
Note that we may use an automated plagiarism checker. Cheating will not be tolerated under any circumstances.

Please review the [BU Academic Conduct Code](https://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/) for more information.

## Supporting Students With Disabilities
If you are a student with a disability or believe you might have a disability that requires accommodations, 
please contact the Office for Disability Services (ODS) at (617) 353-3658 or access@bu.edu to coordinate any reasonable accommodation requests. 
ODS is located at 25 Buick Street on the 3rd floor.
